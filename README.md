# DTMC_LC_3D
arvix: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15526

to study the 3d structure of chiral fluid membrane, forked from DTMC_LC project

the following simulation has been included:

1. fluid membrane as dynamical triangular mesh where each vortex is decorated by director to represent the liquid crystal's orientational order.
2. simulation for membranes with multiple edges is in scope
3. membrane energy includes: Canhan-Helfrich energy for shape, chiral Lebwohl-Lasher for directors
4. we studied: chirality-driven shape change, liquid crystalline orders on cylindrical membrane,
